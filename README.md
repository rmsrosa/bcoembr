# Brew Competition Online Entry & Management - Brazilian Version
Working repository of BCOE&M-BR. 

The Brew Competition Online Entry and Management (BCOE&M) system is an online application to assist homebrew competition hosts (of the beer/mead/cider variety) to collect, store, and manage their competition entry, organization, and scoring data. The BCOE&M-BR is the Brazilian version of this software.

The biggest challenges of organizing a homebrewing competition is knowing who has entered what and how many, organizing judging efficiently, and reporting the results of the competition in a timely manner. BCOE&M provides a single online interface to collect entry and participant data, organize judging tables and assignments, input scoring data, and report the results.

The best part: *BCOE&M is free and open-source*, and so is *BCOE&M-BR*!

[Version BCOE&M-BR 2.0.1.1 is available for download] (https://github.com/rmsrosa/bcoembr/releases). If you need help, [installation] (http://www.brewcompetition.com/install-instructions) and [upgrade] (http://www.brewcompetition.com/upgrade-instructions) instructions are available for the original BCOE&M. Instructions for the Brazilian version are being planned.
